        <p>In the heart of the largest city in the metaverse, tucked between skyscrapers, stands the Digital Donut Shop.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-12 py-5">
        <p>It’s an old abandoned donut bakery, transformed to a cultural landmark for those at the cutting edge of art and technology. Artists and Degens loiter around the parking lot under flickering neon lights, coming in and out of the imposing metal door at the front of the shop. As they pass a sign labeled “Holders Only”, some display a digital token to the scanner, while others turn a shining key in the lock. The scanner beeps, the hinges creak, and the members enter the transmuted shop within.</p>

        <p>Once inside, the smell of freshly baked donuts lingers in the air beside the hum of whirling graphics cards. Pink and blue wires hang from the ceiling and scatter the floor, connecting to various lights, monitors and extensions chords. Members gather around worn brightly colored booths and tables, topped in a layer of donut boxes, coffee and laptops. Some of the members teach classes, while others work with their display turned to the crowd. All are witnessing beautiful and complex animations come alive inside a new frontier. The menu, constantly updating and flashing over the group, has been converted to display private and public NFT offerings and sales, as well as different artists among the group. Members pass around experience, assets and Ethereum between themselves as they mingle between different booths. In back meeting rooms, auctions are held for masterpieces, where proud holders collect the building blocks to the future of art. Some names, not yet widely known, but pervasive to the members, start to gather wider attention and respect among the group. Inside the kitchen, members can be seen loading trucks labeled “Food Bank”, watching as donations stemming from the value created by this group feed their communities around the world.</p>

          Even deeper back, behind the kitchen, is another locked metal door. This entry is only accessible via a large key lock located dead center in the frame. Within is the back office. The desk is covered in papers, AR donuts bobbing up and down, and boxes labeled “Prototypes”. The walls are covered in pictures and words, with wires connecting all of them. On one of the boards is 10 pictures of people, labeled as “Original Core Artists”. They are recognizable as leaders of conversation and direction from the front end of the shop. Above all of this in large lettering is one simple word: Roadmap. A few select members crowd around the boards, scribbling words while receiving images from the front end and pinning them up. It is here that the plans of this group of Artists and Degens is formulated and listed out to a concrete path on which they ascend further into the future.
