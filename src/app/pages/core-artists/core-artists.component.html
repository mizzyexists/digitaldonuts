        <h1>Core Artists</h1>
        <p>As part of our goal to promote 3D artists and add value to our community, the following artists are part of our initial Core Artist team. Please explore their socials and websites. Get to know them! You will be seeing much more of them around the shop, especially during our baking projects.
          <br/><br/>
          Feel free to head over to our DISCORD to suggest artists you want to see added to our team. You can also contact us there or on our TWITTER if you want to get involved!
          <br/><br/>
          I see you are one of the early ones! We have not yet officially announced our first artists. Head over to The Gallery in our discord to help discover the first of our core artist team!
