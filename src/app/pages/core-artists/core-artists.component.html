        <h1>Core Artists</h1>
        <p>As part of our goal to promote 3D artists and add value to our community, the following artists are part of our initial Core Artist team. Please explore their socials and websites. Get to know them! You will be seeing much more of them around the shop, especially during our baking projects.
          <br/><br/>
          Feel free to head over to our <a class="discord" target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/digitaldonuts">DISCORD</a> to suggest artists you want to see added to our team. You can also contact us there or on our <a class="twitter" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/DigitalDonutNFT/">TWITTER</a> if you want to get involved!
